Quadris (Latinization of Tetris) 
CS 246 Fall 2016 
Project Members: Shridhar Sundarraj, Ian Lai, Jonathan Litovitz

To Compile, go to Quadris/final/ and make
./quadris to run


Commands: (Note: These commands are auto-completed. i.e. lef = left, but level is ambiguous as it can be levelup/down)
--------- (Note: You can use multipliers with these commands. i.e. 4lef moves 4left.)

left
right
down
drop

clockwise
counterclockwise

levelup
leveldown

norandom file: Relevant only during levels 3 and 4, this command makes these levels non-
random, instead taking input from the sequence file, starting from the beginning. This is
to facilitate testing
random: Relevant only during levels 3 and 4, this command restores randomness in these levels.

sequence file: Executes the sequence of commands found in file. This is to facilitate the
construction of test cases.

I, J, L, etc.: Useful during testing, these commands replace the current undropped block with
the stated block. Heaviness is detemined by the level number. Note that, for heavy blocks,
these commands do not cause a downward move.

Command Line Interface:
-----------------------

-text: runs the program with text only
-seed xxx: sets the random number generator’s seed to xxx. If you don’t set the seed, you
always get the same random sequence every time you run the program. It’s good for testing,
but not much fun.
-scriptfile xxx: Uses xxx instead of sequence.txt as a source of blocks for level 0
-startlevel n: Starts the game in level n. The game starts in level 0 if this option is not
supplied.

EXTRA FEATURES:
---------------
1.Macro Language: Enable feature by adding flag: -extraFeatureMacro.
Usage: Macro MacroName command1 command2 .... -1. Calling MacroName is
equivalent to calling command1 command2 ... individually. The MacroName can
be called with the least ambiguous name similar to other commands and with
multipliers.

2. Variable Grid Size. Enable feature by adding flag: 
-extraFeatureGrid numRows numCols
